## **Code Overview**

### **Modules Used**
- `os`: For checking and creating files.  
- `datetime`: For validating and managing dates.  
- `colorama`: For colorful CLI output.  
- `reportlab`: For generating PDF reports.

### **Key Functions**

#### **`ensure_file()`**
Ensures that the expense tracking file (`expenses.txt`) exists. If not, it creates one with a header line.

#### **`add_expense()`**
Prompts the user to input expense details (category, amount, and date). The function validates the date format and saves the details into `expenses.txt`.  
**Example**:  
```plaintext
Enter category (e.g., Food, Travel): Travel  
Enter amount: 200  
Enter date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2024-12-24  
view_expenses()

monthly_summary()
Asks for a month and year (MM-YYYY) and calculates total expenses within that period. Expenses are displayed by category with subtotals.

export_summary_to_pdf(month_year)
Takes a month-year as input.
Extracts relevant expense data from the file.
Generates a professionally formatted PDF using reportlab.
Saves the PDF with the filename format Expense_Summary_MM-YYYY.pdf.
